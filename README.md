# Uncommon Assembly Bug: Memory Access Violation

This repository demonstrates a potential bug in assembly code related to memory access. The code snippet attempts to access memory using an address calculated from registers without bounds checking or alignment considerations. This can lead to segmentation faults or bus errors. The solution provided incorporates checks to mitigate these risks.

**Bug:**
The primary issue is the lack of validation for the memory address before accessing it.  Improper alignment can also cause issues.

**Solution:**
The solution addresses the potential issues by implementing range checking and alignment verification before accessing memory.  (Further details in the solution file.)
